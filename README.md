### Elixir in activion learning path.

In this repo I'll save all the my notes taking while reading the book.
the idea is that I'll save those in a `livemd` extension valid for [LiveBook](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook).

### To Install/Run livebook

It's required to have docker:

`docker run -p 8080:8080 --pull always -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v [DIR_WORKING]:/data livebook/livebook`

Import the livemd link from the repo, and start reading, and playing!

Happy learning!
